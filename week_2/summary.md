### Annotations
To compile the c file do this commands in cli "clang file -lcs50" to compile;
 and "./file" to execute.
 In c we have to specify what kind of data the variable is, like string and int(integer)...
"Function added by CS50 library".


Compile with lib <cs50.h> uses "-lcs50".
Compile with lib <math.h> uses "-lm".

With the argument "-o" we can name the output that will come out of the .c file.
Example:
    clang -o outputName file
    clang -o hello hello.c

The make command automates the compilation process, without having to worry about arguments and output filename.
